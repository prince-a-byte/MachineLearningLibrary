# MachineLearningLibrary
This is a machine learning Library completely made from scratch without using any external library like (Sklearn) 


# Day:- 01
> I learned about some of the Utilities of machine learning...

1. Mean Squared Error
2. R2 Score
3. Train Test Split

> Made all three of them completely from scratch using only numpy library and a Maths.....

> This conclude my Day 01...

# Day:- 02
> Things I learned Today....

1. Linear Regression.
2. Ordinary Least Sqaure Method for Linear Regression.
3. Gradient Descent Method for Linear Regression.
4. How to Apply them For Multiple Features.
5. Mathematical Formulation of all the above.

> Today i completed my first Linear Regression Model using Ordinary Least Square method and wrote it completely from scratch using numpy.
> Still have to implement the gradient descent version of the algorithm in the code.

> This Conclude my Day 02 .....

# Day:- 03
> Things I Learned Today.....

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent
2. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
3. Polynomial Regression
4. Mathematical Approach for the above.

> Today i completed my Linear Regression Model using gradient Descent and Ordinary Least Square Method. wrote it completely from scratch using numpy.
> Now my target Would be to complete the Polynomial regression as fast as possible.

> This Conclude my Day 03......
